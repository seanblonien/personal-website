Our goal was to use new technologies in a team environment over multiple months while using best practices in the context of software engineering. With the help of <Link href="https://www.credera.com/" title="Black Credera Company Website">Credera's</Link> mentorship and <Link href="https://github.com/jlutteringer/petfinder-site" title="Template project on GitHub">template project,</Link> we built a pet sitting service web application called <Link href="https://animalis-site.herokuapp.com/" title="Animalis Website">Animalis</Link>. Users can register to find pet sitting services or to sit for other people's pets. Functionalities include managing pets, finding, posting, and managing sessions, receiving email and in-app notifications, rating users, <Link href="https://www.facebook.com/animalissite/" title="Black Animalis on Facebook">social media</Link> integration, and lots of other features that you can browse yourself. Animalis demonstrates reactive and dynamic features that are common in today's single-page web applications. Because of weekly Scrum meetings and software engineering deliverables (i.e. use cases, domain model, etc.) in addition to the programming, this project has made me well versed in all related concepts of web applications, non-relational databases, agile methodologies, CI/CD, and software engineering practices. Screenshots, documentation, code, and guides can be found on <Link href="https://gitlab.com/fall18-group5/group-5" title="Animalis on Gitalb">Animalis' Gitlab</Link>.</p>`,
